<h2>A College Party Safety Kit</h2>
<h3> http://www.harborsafety.org </h3>

**What's the pitch?** To Be A Safety Harbor for College Parties

**Why are we building it?**
<br/ >
  According to <i>Association of American Universities (AAU), 2015</i>, <b>23%</b> female college students said they experienced some form of unwanted sexual contact. <b>32%</b> at Yale and <b>29%</b> at Harvard.
<br/ >
  As a group of college developers and designers, we hope to create an application that does its best to pretect college students before parties, during parties, & after parties. 
<br/ >
**How does it work?**
