<h2>A College Party Safety Kit</h2>
<h4> http://www.harborsafety.org </h4>

**What's the pitch?**   To Be A Safety Harbor for College Parties

**Why are we building it?**<br/ >
According to <i>Association of American Universities (AAU), 2015</i>, <b>23%</b> female college students said they experienced some form of unwanted sexual contact. The statistics is <b>32%</b> at Yale and <b>29%</b> at Harvard.<br/ >
<br/ >
  As a group of college developers and designers, we hope to create an application that does its best to pretect college students before parties, during parties, & after parties. <br/ >
<br/>
<br/>
**How does it work?**
