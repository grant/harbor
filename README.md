<h1>HARBOR APP</H1>
<h2>College Party Safety Kit</h2>
**Live Demo**: http://www.harborsafety.org
The Mission: To Be A Safety Harbor for College Parties

WHY ARE WE BUILDING THIS APP:

According to <i>Association of American Universities (AAU), 2015</i>, <b>23%</b> female college students said they experienced some form of unwanted sexual contact. <b>32%</b> at Yale and <b>29%</b> at Harvard.
As a group of college developers and designers, we hope to create an application that does its best to pretect college students before parties, during parties, & after parties.
