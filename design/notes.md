evaluate accuracy of search engine after completing it
Compare Google search
For a given query
  "I want to sort"
  better search engine would match on top
another could be a user study (most robust way)
create graphs
  string matching
  algorithm name and description
  machine learning
how do you come up with unbiased
do NEL for code instead of a search engine
  you take descriptions you've never seen before
think about what you should output when nothing matches
  split the query "merge sort" to "merge", "sort"
separate training and test data
elastic search
